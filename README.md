# 431a1

Project in intellj idea, should open as is. May need to import external libraries if the project complains about jdk. 

IP and port are hardcoded, will need to be changed on the Server/Client to the Server's ip and whatever is free on both.

Deploy on two machines, compile Client and Server individually on each, then run Server and run Client respectively.

Runs on openjdk version "10.0.2"
